- I write Javascript. I've been doing it for a very long time now.
- I teach others how to write Javascript. You can learn from me either in [Javascript courses for public](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/lektori/riki-fridrich) or you can hire me to prepare a [custom Javascript course for your company](https://chlupatezavorky.com/).
- I frequently speak at conferences and meetups. Mostly about Javascript.
- Lately I started to do [Youtube videos about Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLM7x_Wbs_x0InK93J53nsw).
